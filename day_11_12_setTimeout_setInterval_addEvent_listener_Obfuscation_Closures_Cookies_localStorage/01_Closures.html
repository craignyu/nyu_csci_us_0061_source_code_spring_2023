    <h1>Closures</h1>
    <script type="text/javascript">


      // functions in JavaScript can be 'nested' -- for example, the 'inside' function is nested inside of the 'fun2' function
      // it is a 'local' function to fun2 - the only way to call it invoke it from inside of the 'fun2' function
      function fun2() {

        function inside() {
          console.log("inside was called!");
        }

        inside();
      }

      fun2();


      // nested functions have access to their own variable scope as well as their parent's variable scope.  For example:
      function fun3() {
        let counter = 0;
        function countUp() {
          console.log("Counter started at: ", counter);
          counter += 1; // update the 'counter' variable that is local to our parent's variable scope
          console.log("Counter is now: ", counter);
        }

        countUp();
      }



      // when a function executes JavaScript carves out a little piece of memory to hold the function and all of its variables -
      // but if a function has another function inside of it things can get a little strange.  as long as there is a reference
      // to this region of memory JavaScript will not remove the local variables associated with the function.
      // this region of persistant memory is called a 'closure'
      function fun4() {
        let counter = 0;
        function countUp() {
          counter += 1;
          console.log("Counter is now: ", counter);
        }

        // return a REFERENCE to the local function 'countUp'
        return countUp;
      }

      // 'a' is a link to the countUp function inside of fun3
      let a = fun4();

      // calling 'a' will invoke the countUp function, which manipulates the local variable 'a' inside of fun3
      a();
      // note how the counter variable keeps going up!  this is because the closure is holding onto every local value inside
      // of the function and will not allow it to go away since there is a link to the closure here in the main program
      a();
      a();
      a();

      console.log("-----");

      // if we invoke the function a second time a new closure is formed.  this closure is independent of the one created above,
      // so the local variable can change and have a different value from the previous closure.
      let b = fun4();
      b();
      b();

      console.log("-----");

      // note how 'a' was unaffected by what we did to 'b'
      a();
      b();



      // so why does all of this matter?
      // well, we know that we can tamper with global variables using the JavaScript console
      // we also know that we cannot tamper with local variables inside of a function using the JavaScript console
      // if we were to wrap all of our code inside of a function all aspects of our program would become local variables
      // because there are linkages to our program once the function stops running (i.e. event listeners or other functions)
      // a 'closure' is established which retains all local values for us to continue to work with
